Instructions:
-----------------
Please be sure to run all the alignments (see 
http://bmi214.stanford.edu/files/p1/for_quiz/). Do not 
forget to include the results of this quiz in your submission.  Specifically, 
include a folder called alignments with inputs/outputs, and include your 
answers to the below problems.  See the submission instructions in the main 
Project 1 handout for complete details.

REMEMBER that you must strictly follow the instructions for naming output 
folders and files!!!

Question 1: Global alignment of two DNA sequences.
Input file: alignment0.input
Please fill in the three score matrices (the insertion, deletion, and match matrices). Be sure to include tracebacks (all possible ones) for aligning the sequence in alignment0.input. Name all your matrices and use the according names/symbols for the tracebacks. Example traceback format M(1,1)->Iy(1,0)->M(0,0)
Answer 1:
M=
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1
0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2
0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3

Ix=
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1

Iy=
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1
0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2
Tracebacks:
M(5,4)->M(4,3)->M(3,2)->M(2,1)
M(5,4)->M(4,3)->M(3,2)->Ix(2,1)->M(1,1) 
M(5,4)->M(4,3)->Ix(3,2)->M(2,2)->M(1,1) 
M(5,4)->Iy(4,3)->M(4,2)->Ix(3,1)->M(2,1)
M(5,4)->Iy(4,3)->M(4,2)->Ix(3,1)->Ix(2,1)->M(1,1)


Question 2: Align the sequences in alignment1.input. Look at your results. How would you expect the alignment to look if you modified the gap penalties to be 1.5 for open and 0.5 for extend for both sequences? (Difference in the alignment attributes, size of aligned regions, etc)
Answer 2:
The proposed change will make it less expensive to open a gap (in both sequences), and more expensive to extend the gap (in both sequences). Consequently, we expect to see more gaps as well as shorter gaps. Currently, gaps in sequence A are more expensive, which results in the single, long gap in sequence B and no gaps in sequence A. However, with the proposed change, gaps in both sequences will be equally as expensive, so we expect to see gaps in sequence A, whereas now there aren't any. 


Question 3: Create the alignment2.input file from alignment1.input, except perform a global alignment of the same two DNA sequences with different gap penalties.
Input file: alignment2.input:  
	create this file yourself by modifying  alignment1.input gap penalty to (1.5 0.5 1.5 0.5).
What is the alignment score? 
Answer 3: 8.1

Question 4: Perform the alignment on input file: alignment3.input. Based on the output from alignment3, what is the average number of gap characters in the first sequence?   
(The first sequence is the one that was on line 1 of the input file.)
Answer 4:3.57

Question 5: 
Global alignment of the same two protein sequences with different gap penalties.  
Input file: alignment4.input:  
	create this file yourself by modifying  alignment3.input gap penalty to (1.5 0.5 1.5 0.5)
Based on the output from alignment4, what is the average number of gap characters in the first sequence? If you do not succeed in aligning, explain what you expect to see.
(The first sequence is the one that was on line 1 of the input file.)
Answer 5: 2.5 

Question 6: Global alignment of the same two protein sequences with different gap penalties.  
Input file: alignment5.input:  
	create this file yourself by modifying alignment3.input gap penalty to (4.5 1.5 4.5 1.5)
AWhat is the alignment score?
Answer 6: 580.0 

Question 7:
Based on the output from alignment5, what is the average number of gap characters in the first sequence?  If you do not succeed in aligning, explain what you expect to see.
(The first sequence is the one that was on line 1 of the input file.)
Answer 7: 0

Question 8:
Compare the alignments for sequences 3, 4 and 5. What are the differences you see? Why do you see these differences? 
Answer 8: Alignmetns for sequence 3 had the most gaps, fewer for sequence 4, and no gaps for sequence 5. We see these differences because the cost of starting and extending gaps increases from alignment 3 to alignment 4 and again from alignment 4 to alignment 5.  

Question 9: Perform local alignment of two protein sequences with gap penalty (3 1 3 1).  
Input file:  alignment6.input
How much of each sequence do you see in the alignments? (We do not need an exact number but tell us what parts of the sequences, if any, are missing)
Answer 9: All of sequence 1 is included in the alignment. The second half of sequence 2 is included in the alignment, the first 97 characters from sequence 2 are missing. The last 14 characters of sequence 2 are also missing. 

Question 10 : 
Why would you be interested in performing this kind of local alignment? What might you inferq from the results of these two sequences (what is sequence 1 with respect to sequence 2)?
Answer 10: Sequence 1 is a substring of sequence 2. The two sequences are most likely paralogs. Local alignment can be used to find paralogous genes, which have different function and consequently less sequence similarity than orthologs.

Question 11: Local alignment of the same two protein sequences with different gap penalties.  
Input file: alignment7.input:  
	create this file yourself by modifying alignment6.input gap penalty to (5 1 5 1). If you are not able to perform the alignments, what would you expect to see?
What was the alignment score?
Answer 11: 137.0 

Question 12:
Why do you see a difference in the two alignments?
Answer 12: Alignment 7 has fewer gaps because the cost of initiating a gap has increased from 3 to 5. The gaps that remain are the same length as for alignment 6, since the cost of gap extension has not changed. 

Question 13:
Perform the local alignment of two DNA sequences using alignment8.input
How much of each sequence do you see? (Count the number of letters missing from the front and back of each sequence).
Answer 13: In sequence 1, there are 2 bases missing from the front and 0 missing from the back. In sequence 2, there are 11 bases missing from the front and 5 missing from the back. 

Question 14:
Perform the local alignment of the above (DNA translated into protein) sequences in alignment9.input
How much of each of these sequences do you see? (Count the number of letters missing from the front and back of each sequence).
Answer 14:In sequence 1, there is 1 letter missing from the front and 0 from the back in one set of alignments; there is 1 letter missing from the front and 5 missing from the back in another set of alignments. In sequence 2, there are 4 letters missing from the front and 1 letter missing from the back in one set of alignments; there is 1 letter missing from the front nad 4 letters missing from the back in another set of alignments. 

Question 15:
Discuss the differences between aligning DNA and aligning proteins.
Answer 15: DNA alignment is more sensitive than protein alignment, since DNA alignment does not account for the redundancy of amino acid codons. Consequently, silent mutations would result in a lower alignment score if two sequences are aligned in DNA space, but would not affect the alignment score in protein space. Additionally, the alphabet for DNA alignment consists of 4 letters, while the alphabet of amino acid alignment consists of 20 letters. Consequently, it is easier to achieve a statistically significant alignment in protein space (lower chance of matches by chance). Finally, from a functional perspective, DNA alignment ignores the fact that not all amino acid mutations are equally harmful to protein structure. In protein space, a BLOSUM matrix can be used to assign likelihoods to all possible amino acid substitutions. 

Question 16:
Briefly discuss when you want to use local alignment.
Answer 16: Local alignment should be used when the query is a small subsequence of the reference. An example would be querying a sequence read against a host reference genome. Another use case would be searching for homologous domains in otherwise non-homologous genes. For a use case like  this, global alignment would perform poorly, as it would insert a large number of gaps into the aligned query sequence. 

Question 17: 
Briefly discuss when you want to use global alignment.
Answer 17: Global alignment should be used when the sizes of the query and the reference are relateively similar. An example use case for global alignment is comparison of homologous genes.
